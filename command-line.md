The command line is a way to use a computer with text instructions which are typed into a program by the user, rather than clicking on icons and buttons with a mouse or touchscreen. For example, on Mac OS typing 'open myCV.txt' in the Terminal, to open the file 'myCV', instead of clicking on the document's icon. 

Some examples of Terminal commands.

cd [example name]   : change directory, to the specified [name]
ls                  : lists the files in the current directoy
mkdir [example name]: creates a new directory
rmdir [example name]: removes the named directory
touch [file]        : creates a new file 
pwd                 : outputs your current directory location i.e home/user/Downloads
open [file]         : opens a file as if you clicked on it
man [command]       : Show help for the [command]
cp [file][directory]: Copy [file] to [directory]
exit                : exit the comannd line
